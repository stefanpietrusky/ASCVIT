# ASCVIT V1.5 APP
## Automatic Statistical Calculation, Visualization, and Interpretation Tool

This repository, developed by Stefan Pietrusky, is based on the article published at [Towards Data Science](https://medium.com/towards-data-science/ascvit-v1-automatic-statistical-calculation-visualization-and-interpretation-tool-aa910001a3a7). In this article, I discuss the development of a first version (V1) of a local app that can be used to automatically apply various statistical methods to any datasets. The enhanced version of ASCVIT (V1.5) now includes automatic interpretation of all generated visualisations. This is an open source project for educational and research purposes.

The following statistical procedures are supported by the first Version:

The code to run the app is already in the repository as well as a script (clean.py) to remove missing values from data records. Below is a short GIF showing the structure and function of the app.
